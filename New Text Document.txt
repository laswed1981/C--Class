String is immutable, that means if we create string object then we cannot modify it
and It always create new object of string type in memory.

StringBuilder is mutable,that means if we create string builder object then we can perform any operation like insert, replace or append 
without creating new instance for every time.it will update string at one place in memory doesnt create new space in memory.
